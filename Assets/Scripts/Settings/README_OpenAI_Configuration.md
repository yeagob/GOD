# OpenAI API Key Configuration

This update introduces a configurable OpenAI API key system for Game Of Duck, replacing the previously hardcoded API keys with a secure, editor-configurable solution.

## Overview

The OpenAI API key is now managed through a ScriptableObject configuration system that allows developers to securely configure their API key through the Unity Editor without exposing it in the codebase.

## How to Configure

### Step 1: Create OpenAI Configuration Asset

1. In the Unity Editor, right-click in the Project window
2. Navigate to `Create > Game Of Duck > OpenAI Configuration`
3. Name the asset (e.g., "OpenAIConfig")
4. Place it in a secure location within your project (e.g., `Assets/Settings/`)

### Step 2: Set Your API Key

1. Select the OpenAI Configuration asset
2. In the Inspector, enter your OpenAI API key in the "Api Key" field
3. The system will automatically validate the format (should start with "sk-")
4. Use the "Validate API Key" button to verify the format
5. Use the "Clear API Key" button if you need to remove the key

### Step 3: Assign Configuration to GameOfDuckBoardCreator

1. In your scene, locate the GameObject with the `GameOfDuckBoardCreator` component
2. In the Inspector, find the "OpenAI Configuration" field under the "OpenAI Configuration" section
3. Drag your OpenAI Configuration asset to this field
4. The system will validate the configuration and show warnings if the API key is invalid

## Architecture Changes

### New Components

- **OpenAIConfigurationData**: ScriptableObject that securely stores the OpenAI API key
- **Enhanced GameOfDuckBoardCreator**: Now includes OpenAI configuration management
- **Updated AIJsonGenerator**: Receives API key as constructor parameter
- **Enhanced BoardCreationService**: Validates API key on initialization

### Security Improvements

- API keys are no longer hardcoded in the source code
- Configuration is validated at runtime
- Clear error messages when configuration is missing or invalid
- Editor-only validation tools

### Validation System

The system includes multiple validation layers:

1. **Format Validation**: Ensures API key starts with "sk-"
2. **Configuration Validation**: Checks if configuration asset is assigned
3. **Runtime Validation**: Verifies API key availability during game initialization
4. **Service Validation**: Confirms AI services are properly initialized

## Error Handling

If the OpenAI configuration is missing or invalid:

- The game will display a clear error message
- AI-powered board generation will be disabled
- The system will prevent crashes and provide meaningful feedback

## Migration from Previous Version

If you're upgrading from a version with hardcoded API keys:

1. Create a new OpenAI Configuration asset as described above
2. Copy your API key from the old hardcoded location
3. Assign the configuration to your GameOfDuckBoardCreator component
4. The old hardcoded keys have been removed from the codebase

## Best Practices

### Security

- **Never commit API keys to version control**
- Add your OpenAI Configuration assets to `.gitignore`
- Use different configurations for different environments (dev, staging, production)
- Regularly rotate your API keys

### Organization

- Store configuration assets in a dedicated `Settings` folder
- Use descriptive names for your configuration assets
- Create separate configurations for team members if needed

### Development Workflow

1. Each developer should create their own OpenAI Configuration asset
2. Keep configuration assets out of version control
3. Document the configuration process for new team members
4. Use the validation tools to ensure proper setup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OpenAI Configuration not found or invalid"**
- Ensure you've created an OpenAI Configuration asset
- Verify the asset is assigned to the GameOfDuckBoardCreator component
- Check that your API key is valid and starts with "sk-"

**"API Key format is invalid"**
- OpenAI API keys should start with "sk-"
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters
- Verify you're using a valid OpenAI API key

**AI services not working**
- Check the Console for detailed error messages
- Verify your API key has the necessary permissions
- Ensure your OpenAI account has sufficient credits

### Debug Mode

For debugging purposes, you can:
1. Check the "API Key Status" in the OpenAI Configuration Inspector
2. Use the "Validate API Key" button to test format validity
3. Monitor the Console for detailed error messages during initialization
